      <h1>Section 2: JavaScript Language Basics</h1>
    <h4>Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.</h4>
<h4>1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height</h4>
<h4>2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.</h4>
<h4>3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.</h4>

<p>Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).</p>

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
